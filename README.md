# Pool Program

Rust smart contract for Solana liquidity pools with variable token number.


## Building
To build the Pool program, use the normal build command for Solana programs:

```bash
cargo build-bpf
```



## Deployment
To deploy the pool program:
1. Check that the `TOKEN_COUNT` const is set to the number of constituent tokens you want the pool program to initialize
2. Build the program:
  ```bash
  cargo build-bpf
  ```
3. Deploy the program using:
  ```bash
  solana program deploy --program-id <path_to_keypair> ./target/deploy/pool.so
  ```
4. To adjust the number of constituent tokens for the Pool Program, adjust the `TOKEN_COUNT` const in `src/entrypoint.rs` then rebuild and deploy the program to a new program_id

## Audits and Security
Audit scheduled, starting ~Nov 1st 2021

## Mainnet Deployments
Pools with 4 Tokens: `SWiMBJS9iBU1rMLAKBVfp73ThW1xPPwKdBHEU2JFpuo`

Pools with 6 Tokens: `SWiMDJYFUGj6cPrQ6QYYYWZtvXQdRChSVAygDZDsCHC`

## Running Tests

```bash
cd swim/pool
# run all tests
cargo test-bpf -- --show-output
# run all tests with suppressed noisy logs
cargo test-bpf -- --show-output --nocapture --test-threads=1 2>&1 | ./sol_spam_filter.py
# run specific test
cargo test-bpf -- --test test_pool_init --show-output
```

# Fuzzing
- workaround for honggfuzz macos x incompatability found [here](https://github.com/ilmoi/rebuild-token-vesting)
  - TLDR: use docker 
- docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app/ pool bash
  - TLDR: use docker
How to run fuzz tests on mac os x in docker container
```sh
# 1. build docker container (only have to do this one time)
$ docker build -t pool .
# 2. run docker container
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app/ pool bash
# should be in the docker container now
$ cd fuzz
$ BPF_OUT_DIR="/app/target/deploy" HFUZZ_RUN_ARGS="-t 10 -n 1 -N 100 -Q  " cargo hfuzz run pool_fuzz 
# redirect output to files
$ BPF_OUT_DIR="/app/target/deploy" HFUZZ_RUN_ARGS="-t 10 -n 1 -N 100 -Q -d -v -l ./fuzz.log -R ./fuzz_report.log " cargo hfuzz run pool_fuzz > test_output.txt 2>&1
# -t = timeout in seconds
# -n = number of threads
# -N = number of iterations

``` 

if you run into an error on the last step with something like this:
"fatal error: ld terminated with signal 9"
you need to go to Docker Desktop and increase the memory and swap then retry again


### Personal notes
rebuild-token-vesting
- uses solana_program_test
- random tx generated by arbitrary/fuzz gets translated to all pre-requesite ixs needed
  - e.g. create gets translated to init + create

spl-token-swap
- doesn't use solana_program_test in fuzzing
